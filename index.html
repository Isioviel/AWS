            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">Code of Conduct - The Quick Version</h2>
            <p>
              AWS60 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone,
              regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
              disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not tolerate harassment of AWS60 participants in any form.
              Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in our venue,
              or on social media surrounding the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled
              from the event at the discretion of the organisers.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead bg-blue">Code of Conduct - The Less Quick Version</h2>
            <p>
              Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
              age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
              religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
              stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of the event,
              inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate,
              including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
              or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
              Organisers will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement,
              provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe
              for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
            </p>
            <p>
              We expect participants to follow these rules at the event,
              related social events, and on social media surrounding the event.
